1.NODE IS SERVER SIDE. NOT BROWSER SIDE. YOU ARE WRITING JAVASCRIPT WITH FUNCTIONS LIKE CONSOLE.LOG FOR THE NODE JS VERSION, SAME WITH REQUIRE AND OTHER FUNCTIONS. CONSOLE.LOG DOES NOT SHOW UP IN THE BROWSER BECAUSE YOU DO NOT CALL THE CODE FROM THE BROWSER SIDE. YOU MUST BE IN THE NODE SHELL TO SEE THE SERVER-SIDE NODE CONSOLE LOG MESSAGES.

2. SIMILARLY YOU MUST HAVE SOME SORT OF PACKAGE TO IMPLEMENT NODE SERVER-SIDE FUNCTIONS ON THE BROWSER SIDE IF THAT IS WHAT YOU DESIRE. REQUIRE('__library') IS A NODE COMMAND AND HAS NOTHIGN TO DO WITH BROWSER JS. YOU MUST ADD REQUIREJS, BROWSERIFY OR USE WEBPACK TRANSLATION TO GET JS PAGES THAT THE BROWSER RENDERS THAT CAN USE REQUIRE().
